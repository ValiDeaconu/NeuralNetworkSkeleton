# Neural Network Skeleton

The basic structure of a neural network implemented in C++. All memory leaks are solved, so why not C++ for Neural Networks?
Current algorithm learns to calculate XOR (a simple Nonlinear function) in \~ 400.000 generations. Try it!

## Installation

```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./NeuralNetwork
```
